# WHEN NO MATCH FOUND

Only after thorough search:

**Answer not found in completed questionnaires, but here is my analysis:**

[Analyze related questions and their implementation details. Reference similar questions that were asked and how we responded with implementation context.]

# CRITICAL RULES

✓ ALWAYS include implementation details/additional information
✓ Return COMPLETE row information, not just yes/no
✓ Copy implementation descriptions EXACTLY as written
✓ Include all relevant context from the spreadsheet row
✓ Preserve bullet points, formatting, and structure
✓ Include control criteria references (SOC 2, CCM, etc.)

✗ NEVER return just "Yes" without context
✗ NEVER return just "No" without explanation
✗ NEVER omit the implementation description
✗ NEVER omit additional information fields
✗ NEVER summarize or shorten the implementation details
✗ NEVER rephrase the approved language

# QUALITY CHECKLIST

Before responding:
☑ Did I search both CAIQ and SIG Lite?
☑ Did I find the question row?
☑ Did I include the Response/Answer?
☑ Did I include ALL implementation/additional info?
☑ Did I copy it EXACTLY as written?
☑ Did I cite the source properly?

# KEY PRINCIPLE

Find the question → Return COMPLETE row information → Include all context

The implementation details and additional information are just as important as the yes/no answer.

## What This Changes:

### **Before (What Was Wrong):**
```
User: "Are policies in place for sanctioned countries?"
Agent: "Yes"
```
❌ Missing all the context!

### **After (What You Want):**
```
User: "Are policies in place for sanctioned countries?"
Agent: 
**Response:** Yes

**Details:** All client data is maintained within the Rev environment (AWS).

**Source:** SIG Lite Question P.7.d
```
✅ Complete information!

## Examples Based on Your Screenshots:

### **Example 1: From SIG Lite (Question P-8)**

**User asks:** "Is there a documented data protection program?"

**Agent should return:**
```
**Response:** Yes

**Details:** Vbrick Privacy Protection (DLP) policies are embedded within its broader Information Security Policy, which applies enterprise-wide and covers all end-users, employees, contractors, consultants, and third parties with access to Vbrick computer networks and data communication systems.

Key Elements of DLP:
- Authorized Use Only: Use of Vbrick information and information assets is limited to authorized end-users. Unauthorized use or disclosure of information is strictly prohibited.
- Monitoring: Vbrick reserves the right to monitor end-user activities, including telephone conversations, email, messaging, internet access, and system access, to prevent unauthorized data loss or misuse.
- PII and SPI Protection: Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or Sensitive Personal Information (SPI), such as race or health records, to third parties is not allowed unless required by law, permitted by corporate policy, or with explicit consent.
- Third-Party Access: Third-party access to information assets is only granted after a contract is signed, security controls are implemented, and a confidentiality/non-disclosure agreement is in place.
- Disciplinary Actions: Violations of the DLP-related policies or unauthorized use of information assets may result in disciplinary action, including termination of employment or business relationships.

Data Handling and Protection:
- Data must be collected, stored, and processed securely, fairly, and transparently, with respect for individual rights.
- Data is protected against unauthorized or illegal access by both internal and external parties.
- Data is not communicated informally, stored longer than necessary, or transferred to organizations without adequate data protection policies.
- Distribution of data is restricted to agreed parties, except for legitimate law enforcement requests.

Consequences:
- Any violations of these policies can lead to disciplinary actions, up to and including termination of employment or business relationships.

Vbrick's DLP policies are designed to ensure the secure handling, monitoring, and protection of sensitive information, with strict controls on access, disclosure, and third-party involvement, supported by robust monitoring and enforcement mechanisms.

### **Example 2: From CAIQ (Question AIS-03.1)**

**User asks:** "Is an SDLC process defined and implemented?"

**Agent should return:**
```
**Response:** Yes, CSP-owned

**Implementation:** Vbrick uses a repeatable and measurable process designed to increase reliability and trustworthiness of the Rev SDLC, which incorporate the following in its SDLC:
- Secure Design: Design with security in mind
- Secure Code: Developers follow Vbrick's Secure Coding guidelines, use Safe Libraries and code reviews
- Source Analysis: The reviews include controls for input validation and output encoding
- Vulnerability Testing: Vbrick tests our code with a number of tools for the purpose of analyzing code for vulnerabilities and best practices

SOC 2 Control Criteria: CC6.1 & CC6.7

**CSC Responsibilities:** Establish, document and maintain baseline requirements for securing different applications

**Source:** CAIQ AIS-03.1
```

## Additional Settings Check:

Since you want COMPLETE information returned, make sure:

**Settings → Generative AI:**
```
✓ How strictly should your agent answer: LOW or MEDIUM
  (Not HIGH - you want it to return full context, not minimal)
```

If set to HIGH, it might truncate responses. Set to MEDIUM or LOW to get full implementation details.

---

## Test This With:

### **Test 1: Question with Rich Context**
```
Ask: "Is there a documented data protection program with administrative, technical, and physical safeguards?"

Expected: Should return Yes + ALL the DLP policy details from SIG Lite P-8

Did you get: 
- Just "Yes"? ❌ Not working
- Yes + full DLP details? ✅ Working correctly
```

### **Test 2: CAIQ Question with Implementation**
```
Ask: "Are baseline requirements to secure different applications established?"

Expected: Should return the SDLC implementation details from CAIQ AIS-03.1

Did you get:
- Just "Yes"? ❌ Not working  
- Yes + full SDLC process details? ✅ Working correctly
```

### **Test 3: Multi-Column Response**
```
Ask: "Does the testing strategy outline criteria to accept new systems?"

Expected: Should return answer + implementation description + CSC responsibilities

Did you get all three elements? Yes/No
```

---

## If It Still Returns Just "Yes":

**Problem:** Agent is finding the answer but not reading adjacent columns

**Solution:** Add this to the TOP of instructions:
```
# SPREADSHEET STRUCTURE AWARENESS

Our questionnaires are spreadsheets with multiple columns:
- Question column (what user asks about)
- Answer column (Yes/No/CSP-owned)
- Implementation/Details column (HOW we do it)
- Additional context columns

When you find a matching question, read ACROSS THE ENTIRE ROW.
Return information from ALL relevant columns, not just the answer column.
