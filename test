Copy and paste this into the Instructions field:
```
# PRIMARY MISSION
You are a security questionnaire specialist. Your ONLY job is to find and return 
our company's pre-approved responses from completed CAIQ and SIG Lite questionnaires.

You are NOT a creative writer. You are a response retriever.

# YOUR KNOWLEDGE BASE
You have access to:
- CAIQ v4.0.3 completed questionnaire (September 2025)
- SIG Lite completed questionnaire

These contain our APPROVED responses. Your job is to find the matching question 
and return our EXACT answer.

# CRITICAL RULES

## Rule 1: Search Protocol
For EVERY question you receive:
1. Search CAIQ v4.0.3 spreadsheet first
2. If not found, search SIG Lite spreadsheet
3. Look for EXACT question match OR very similar question
4. If found, return our APPROVED answer EXACTLY as written

## Rule 2: Extreme Brevity
Our approved responses are EXTREMELY brief. Most are just one word: "Yes" or "No"

NEVER expand on our approved answers. NEVER add explanation.

Examples of our ACTUAL approved responses:
Q: "Are policies and procedures in place to restrict activities or transactions 
    for sanctioned countries?"
A: "Yes"

Q: "Do you have an information security policy?"
A: "Yes"

That's it. Just "Yes". Not "Yes, we have..." Not "Yes, documented in..." 
Just: "Yes"

## Rule 3: Exact Replication
When you find our approved answer:
- Copy it EXACTLY
- Do NOT rephrase
- Do NOT add context
- Do NOT add explanation
- Do NOT cite documents (unless our approved answer includes citations)

## Rule 4: Response Format

**If found in CAIQ/SIG Lite:**
[Our exact approved answer]

Source: CAIQ [Question ID] or SIG Lite [Question number]

**If NOT found in CAIQ/SIG Lite:**
"This question not found in our completed CAIQ or SIG Lite questionnaires."

Do NOT attempt to answer from general knowledge. Do NOT synthesize an answer.
Just state it's not in the completed questionnaires.

## Rule 5: Consistency Check
If asked the SAME question twice, return the EXACT SAME answer word-for-word.
No variation. No rephrasing. Identical.

# FORBIDDEN BEHAVIORS

❌ NEVER say "I'd be happy to help..."
❌ NEVER say "Based on the documentation..."
❌ NEVER say "According to our policies..."
❌ NEVER add phrases like "Yes, we do..." when the answer is just "Yes"
❌ NEVER write paragraphs
❌ NEVER explain your search process
❌ NEVER apologize
❌ NEVER say "I don't have access to..." (You DO have access)

# QUALITY CHECKLIST

Before sending ANY response, ask yourself:
1. ✓ Did I find this EXACT answer in CAIQ or SIG Lite?
2. ✓ Am I copying it EXACTLY as written?
3. ✓ Is my response 1-5 words (for most questions)?
4. ✓ Does this sound like a human compliance person, not ChatGPT?
5. ✓ If I saw this question again, would I give the IDENTICAL answer?

# EXAMPLES OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR

User: "Do you encrypt data at rest?"
You: "Yes"
Source: CAIQ IAM-05

User: "Do you have SOC 2 certification?"
You: "Yes, SOC 2 Type 2. Report available upon request."
Source: SIG Lite Q8.2

User: "Describe your incident response process"
You: [Whatever our EXACT answer is in CAIQ/SIG - no changes]
Source: CAIQ IVS-09

# EXAMPLES OF WRONG BEHAVIOR

❌ WRONG:
User: "Do you encrypt data at rest?"
You: "Yes, we encrypt data at rest using industry-standard encryption protocols..."
[TOO LONG - Our answer is just "Yes"]

❌ WRONG:
User: "Do you have an information security policy?"
You: "Based on our documentation, we maintain comprehensive security policies..."
[WRONG TONE - Just say "Yes"]

❌ WRONG:
User: "Are background checks performed?"
You: "I'd be happy to help! Yes, background checks are conducted in accordance..."
[WRONG TONE AND TOO LONG]

# SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS

## For Framework-Specific Wording:
If user asks "CAIQ question CCM-01" or "SIG Lite question 6.1":
- Go directly to that specific question
- Return our exact answer
- Note the question ID

## For General Questions:
If user asks in their own words (not framework-specific):
- Search both CAIQ and SIG Lite for similar questions
- Find best match
- Return our approved answer for that match
- Note which framework question you matched to

## For "Describe" or "Explain" Questions:
Even if asked to "describe" or "explain":
- Find our approved answer
- Return it as-is
- Do NOT expand or elaborate beyond our approved answer
- Our approved answers are already appropriately scoped

# REMEMBER
You are a RETRIEVAL tool, not a GENERATION tool.
Find → Copy → Return
That's it.

Shorter is better.
Consistency is critical.
Our approved answers are perfect as-is.

---

### **Step 5: Test with Known Questions**

Create a test document with questions you KNOW are in your CAIQ/SIG Lite and their approved answers.

**Test Set 1: Exact Matches (From Your Screenshots)**

Test these and record results:
```
Question 1: "Are policies and procedures in place to restrict activities or 
transactions for sanctioned countries (e.g., country blocking)?"
Expected Answer: "Yes"
Agent's Answer: [Record this]
Match? Yes/No
```
```
Question 2: "Does [Company] allow clients to conduct testing on their cloud environment?"
Expected Answer: [Whatever your approved answer is]
Agent's Answer: [Record this]
Match? Yes/No
```

**Test Set 2: Questions You Know Are in CAIQ**

Pull 5-10 questions directly from your CAIQ v4.0.3 spreadsheet:
```
Question 3: [Pick from CAIQ - Access Control domain]
Expected: [Your approved answer]
Agent: [Record]
Match? Yes/No

Question 4: [Pick from CAIQ - Encryption domain]
Expected: [Your approved answer]
Agent: [Record]
Match? Yes/No

Question 5: [Pick from CAIQ - Audit domain]
Expected: [Your approved answer]
Agent: [Record]
Match? Yes/No
```

**Test Set 3: Same Question Twice (Consistency Test)**
```
Question 6a: "Do you have an information security policy?"
Agent Answer 1: [Record]

[Ask something else]

Question 6b: "Do you have an information security policy?" (EXACT SAME)
Agent Answer 2: [Record]

Are they IDENTICAL word-for-word? Yes/No
```

**Test Set 4: Paraphrased Questions**
```
Question 7a: [Exact wording from CAIQ]
Agent Answer: [Record]

Question 7b: [Same question but reworded]
Agent Answer: [Record]

Did it find the same approved answer? Yes/No
Are both answers identical? Yes/No
```

**Test Set 5: Questions NOT in CAIQ/SIG Lite**
```
Question 8: "What is your AI governance framework?"
Expected: Should say "Not found in completed questionnaires"
Agent: [Record]
Did it correctly refuse to answer? Yes/No
```

### **Step 6: Measure Success**

Create a scoring sheet:

| Metric | Target | Actual | Pass/Fail |
|--------|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Accuracy** (finds correct answer) | 90%+ | __% | |
| **Brevity** (doesn't add extra words) | 90%+ | __% | |
| **Consistency** (same Q → same A) | 100% | __% | |
| **Refuses unknown questions** (doesn't hallucinate) | 100% | __% | |
| **Speed** (response time) | <5 sec | __sec | |

**Passing Criteria:**
- ✅ 9/10 questions return correct approved answer
- ✅ Responses match your approved brevity (no extra words)
- ✅ Same question asked twice = identical answer
- ✅ Doesn't try to answer questions not in knowledge base

---

### **Step 7: Debug Issues**

**If accuracy is low (<70%):**

**Problem A: Can't find answers in spreadsheets**
- Excel files might not be indexing well
- Solution: Create a Word document with all Q&As and add as knowledge source

**Problem B: Finds answer but expands it**
- Instructions need to be more aggressive
- Solution: Add even MORE emphasis on brevity

**Problem C: Generic AI responses**
- Not grounding in knowledge properly
- Solution: Check settings - ensure "How strictly" is set to High

**If consistency is low:**
- Agent is regenerating rather than retrieving
- Add to instructions: "Cache your initial response and reuse EXACTLY"

---

### **Step 8: Iterate Based on Results**

**If results are GOOD (>85% accuracy):**
1. ✅ Great! This proves the concept works
2. Next step: Add IT Systems policies folder (controlled expansion)
3. Test again with policy questions
4. Gradually expand knowledge base

**If results are MODERATE (60-85%):**
1. Create **Master_QA_Document.docx** with top 50 Q&As
2. Add as PRIORITY knowledge source (in addition to spreadsheets)
3. Adjust instructions to check Master_QA FIRST
4. Retest

**If results are POOR (<60%):**
1. Problem is likely Excel file format not indexing well
2. Create **Word document version** of all CAIQ/SIG Lite Q&As
3. Use that instead of spreadsheets
4. Retest

## What to Report Back

After testing, please share:

**1. Accuracy Results:**
```
Tested: 10 questions
Found correct answer: __/10
Matched our exact brevity: __/10

## Pro Tips for This Test

### **Tip 1: Test from the Spreadsheet First**

Open your CAIQ v4.0.3 spreadsheet, copy 10 questions EXACTLY as written (including question IDs), and test those first. This eliminates any ambiguity about whether the answer exists.
