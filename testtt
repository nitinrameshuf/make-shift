OSCAL Assessment and Integration Report
Part 2: Assessing What OSCAL Can Do
1. Enable Automated Generation of Compliance Artifacts
How it can be achieved:
Configure security tools (e.g., vulnerability scanners, SIEM systems, asset management tools) to export results in OSCAL format.
Implement middleware or adapters to convert proprietary outputs into OSCAL-compliant data where direct export is not possible.
Build workflows that automatically feed compliance data into reporting dashboards for FedRAMP readiness.
Possible solutions:
Use NIST’s OSCAL conversion libraries to transform JSON/XML/YAML outputs.
Adopt compliance platforms like OpenControl, Xacta, or Aegis Compliance that natively support OSCAL.
Create custom exporters from commonly used tools (e.g., Tenable, Qualys, Splunk) into OSCAL format.
2. Controls Implementation Documentation
How it can be achieved:
Centralize all control-related data into an OSCAL-compatible repository.
Automate evidence collection (e.g., configuration baselines, scan reports, incident logs) into OSCAL.
Use visualization tools that generate real-time dashboards and compliance heat maps for stakeholders.
Possible solutions:
Deploy an OSCAL repository (such as Git-based repos) to store living documentation of controls.
Integrate with open-source compliance tracking tools like Compliance Masonry.
Connect GRC solutions (e.g., Archer, ServiceNow GRC) with OSCAL data feeds for automated reporting.
3. Change Management
How it can be achieved:
Automate capture of system changes (patches, configuration modifications, deployment updates) through DevSecOps pipelines.
Update OSCAL compliance documentation automatically whenever system state changes.
Implement alerts that notify compliance teams when changes impact FedRAMP controls.
Possible solutions:
Integrate CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions) with OSCAL reporting.
Use Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tools like Terraform or Ansible to document system changes and export OSCAL records.
Apply change tracking tools such as ServiceNow Change Management with OSCAL export enabled.
4. Integration with Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) Tools
How it can be achieved:
Map OSCAL data to GRC frameworks so compliance posture can be tracked across risk registers, audits, and remediation tasks.
Use APIs to integrate OSCAL data streams directly into GRC systems.
Ensure consistent bidirectional data flow: compliance tools provide OSCAL data, GRC systems consume and manage it.
Possible solutions:
Integrate OSCAL with RSA Archer, ServiceNow GRC, or ZenGRC for end-to-end compliance visibility.
Use middleware APIs or data bus solutions (e.g., MuleSoft, Apache Kafka) to connect different tools.
For open-source, explore OpenControl + OSCAL as a lightweight GRC alternative.
Part 3: Integrating OSCAL into Our Processes
Step 1: Assess and Map Tool Chain to OSCAL Requirements
How it can be achieved:
Perform a gap analysis of all existing tools (vulnerability scanners, ticketing systems, monitoring tools, CI/CD pipelines).
Create a mapping document that shows how each tool’s outputs align with OSCAL schema.
Identify where OSCAL-native support is missing and where conversion/adapters are required.
Possible solutions:
Develop a compliance mapping matrix linking current tool outputs to OSCAL formats.
Use OSCAL schema validation tools (NIST provides them) to check compatibility.
Step 2: Identify Systems and Processes for Automation
How it can be achieved:
Break down FedRAMP control families (AC, AU, CM, IR, etc.) and evaluate which controls can be automated.
Quantify automation opportunities (e.g., “40 out of 60 controls can be automated”).
Prioritize controls that are high-effort or high-frequency (e.g., vulnerability scanning, audit logging, patch management).
Possible solutions:
Use a control-mapping framework like NIST 800-53 OSCAL catalog to identify where automation is feasible.
Automate evidence collection from SIEM (Splunk, Elastic), scanners (Qualys, Nessus), and configuration tools.
Step 3: Research Commercial and Open Source Tools
How it can be achieved:
Conduct a market survey of OSCAL-compatible tools, scoring them against criteria like cost, support, automation capability, and FedRAMP alignment.
Test open-source OSCAL tools for flexibility and extensibility.
Document trade-offs (e.g., open-source = lower cost, higher customization; commercial = faster adoption, better support).
Possible solutions:
Commercial: Xacta 360, Aegis Compliance, Telos OSCAL Suite.
Open-source: Compliance Masonry, OpenControl, NIST OSCAL tooling libraries.
Step 4: Conduct a Pilot Trial
How it can be achieved:
Select 5–10 controls across multiple domains (e.g., access control, incident response, audit logging) to trial.
Configure one OSCAL-enabled tool to manage these controls end-to-end.
Evaluate results: time saved, accuracy, integration ease, stakeholder usability.
Use lessons learned to refine the roadmap for broader rollout.
Possible solutions:
Start with Compliance Masonry (open-source) for proof-of-concept.
Run a small-scale pilot with a commercial tool like Xacta to validate enterprise readiness.
Develop custom OSCAL exporters for one or two existing security tools to test internal integration.
✅ Summary:
By adopting OSCAL, organizations can automate evidence generation, streamline control documentation, simplify change management, and integrate seamlessly with GRC platforms. The roadmap involves mapping current tools, identifying automation opportunities, testing solutions (commercial and open source), and validating them through a controlled pilot program.
